<b>Resume Improvements:</b>
<br>
In Brycen's resume he highlights his projects much more heavily than I have. I think that, that could be a good idea.
<br>
Jackson's resume has multiple certificates. I have thought about getting more myself. I think that could add more weight to my resume.
<br>
Ryan's resume had github links to the projects he put on it. I think this is a good idea so that they can be found easily.

<b>Job Posting & Evaluation:</b>
<br>
Epic - Software Developer role
https://www.epic.com/<br>
Epic is a healthcare software development company. I know some Javascript which was part of the tech stack. I was able to do an interview with this company and I really enjoyed my conversation with the interviewer. The other parts of the tech stack I was not as familiar with. .NET/C#, Java/Kotlin, Cache are some of the things that I could learn more about to give myself a better chance of getting a job here in the future.

Copeland - Computer Science
https://www.copeland.com/en-us
Copeland is a company close to my wifes home. This gave me a few connections there. I think I would have been a good fit for this spot, because of my background. Much of the company is engineering based and with my minor in Electrical and Computer engineering and programming I could have had a unique perspective on some aspects of the job. It also had an emphasis on people with python experience which I have as well. Some things I could have done better to take full advantage of this opportunity is to have been more familiar with the requirements and expectations. I think this is important because it will show more of my interest in the company.

Family Search Internship

Working for the Church of Jesus Christ would obviously be great! Not because it would be easy or even the greatest work environment. I can say it would be, but I can say that it would be more fulfilling than any other job. No other organizations have eternal consequences. That being said besides a familarty with the goals of what this job is trying to accomplish I was not overlly quilfied for it. When I talked to a recurter some of the things I could do to improve my chances are to learn about and know how to use Rest API's and working with clouds.

<b>SMART Goals:</b>
<br>
A common thread that I am finding is that I simply don't have the greatest qualifications of job. With the entry level jobs/internships I have looked at it is not likely that I will need to be the most qualified person in the world, but I think I could look for what companies are looking for and work on those things specific items. Looking at Eros' he pointed out cloud computing as something to work on and machine learning. Both of these things are highly desired skills and would be great to be able to say that I have experience in them. Levi mentioned clouds. That is definitely something I should learn about.
<br>
From classmates:
S - Learn what cloud computing is and how to get started learning about it.
M - Spend 30 minutes a day reading about or practicing cloud computing.
A - 30 minutes is not much and should definitely be achievable.
R - I am not planning on become an expert tomorrow. This is a really good small step I can take to increase my value to employers.
T - I want to do this until next Wednesday and revaluate then.
<br>
S - Apply for one job a day that are python focused.
M - I just need to record if I have applied for one.
A - Python is a popular language it should be possible to find jobs that have a focus on them.
R - I do have a hard time applying for jobs, but one a day is not much and I will feel more confident if I feel qualified for the position.
Time - Doing this for the next week will be a good show if I am able to find what I am looking for.
