<b>Resume:</b>
[Thomas Jamieson - Resume](<Thomas Jamieson_Resume.pdf>)
There are several things that make me stand out from my resume. One thing is my minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. These studies have given me a much greater understanding of how the technology that we work with every day works. As a programmer it is helpful to have an understanding of the inner workings of computers. Another aspect of my resume that I think stands out are some of my projects.
